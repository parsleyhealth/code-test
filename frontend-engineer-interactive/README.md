# Ingest Form Application

### Overview

In this task you'll be creating a simple, single-page, **React** application.

> If you have any questions email me at michael@parsleyhealth.com.

### Prompt

I would like you to create a **multi-step** or **multi-screen** patient ingest
form that gathers standard medical data. Here is a list of data points, disease
and questions you might want to use:
https://github.com/parsleyhealth/recruiting/tree/master/frontend-engineer-interactive/fixtures.md

Here is a suggested organization of the form, but use your best judgement and
creativity:

1.  **Demographic data**: name, email, address, birthdate, etc
2.  **Medical history information**: family history, medications, diseases,
    allergies
3.  **Acceptance of a contract** (lorem ipsum text is fine)
4.  **Summary**: show the patient a wrap-up screen with the info they added, and
    give them a way to go back and edit if there are any mistakes
5.  **Submit**: On submit, please print the payload you collected to the
    console. This is your fake API submission.

Please note:

* This is a **single-page application**. There shouldn't be page reloads between
  screens.

### Time limits

Please turn in your results within **72-hours** of the prompt being given. If
that falls during the weekend, then please turn it in by Monday.

> Extensions are available, just ask!

### Evaluation & priorities

I don't expect you to create something perfect and highly polished — 
please try to limit yourself to 4-8 hours working time. I hope in that time
you'll prioritize the following, in this order. Consider this an iterative 
process — get it working on sound principles first, then refine and polish 
as time allows.

1.  **Make it work!**
2.  **Clean and clear code** (hopefully you didn't sacrifice this to make it work)
3.  **Organization**
4.  **Planning**: tools used, implementation strategy, basic UX concerns like what
    to ask for where
5.  Management of **data, state, and events** internally
6.  **Make it look good**: Just use [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/), 
    [ant design](https://ant.design/docs/react/use-with-create-react-app) or another
    UI kit you're comfortable with.
7.  Simple **tests** are highly desirable (required for senior roles)

### Delivery of project

Please place your finished source code on GitHub, Gitlab, or send as a zipped file to me.

### Wrap up

When you've finished the test let me know by email: michael@parsleyhealth.com

We will then schedule a short (30 min or less) wrap-up call to go over your
results and the thinking you applied to this project.

### Hints

* Be efficient! Please don’t reinvent the wheel, use scaffolds like 
  [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) 
  and [tools](http://redux-form.com/) when they speed up your 
  process and get you to your end goal faster.
